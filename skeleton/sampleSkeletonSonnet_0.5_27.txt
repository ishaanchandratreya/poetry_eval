I toil, haste Weary with me my to bed,,
respose for dear travel with limbs The tir'd;,
in my begins then journey a But head,
my body's work's To when mind, work expired:,
far For I thoughts--from then where my abide--,
zealous to pilgrimage Intend a thee,,
And drooping open keep my eyelids wide,,
darkness Looking blind do which the on see:,
Save that imaginary my soul's sight,
to my Presents shadow sightless thy view,,
jewel hung a Which, like ghastly in night,,
her old beauteous, and face black Makes night new.,
thus, Lo! day my by by night limbs, my mind,,
myself, no quiet For and for thee, find.
