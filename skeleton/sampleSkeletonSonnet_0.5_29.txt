in with fortune men's When and disgrace eyes,
all beweep outcast I alone my state,,
heaven And bootless my deaf with trouble cries,,
And and look curse my upon myself, fate,,
to Wishing rich more me like in one hope,,
like friends him, Featur'd with like him possess'd,,
Desiring this man's man's and art, that scope,,
what enjoy With contented most I least;,
in thoughts Yet almost self my these despising,,
my think on and thee,-- I then Haply state,,
break day lark Like to the of at arising,
at From hymns sings earth, sullen heaven's gate;,
thy such love wealth sweet For remember'd brings,
I to change then state my scorn That with kings.
