the on heavy journey How I do way,,
I weary what seek, When my travel's end,,
and teach that ease Doth to repose that say,,
measured far 'Thus are thy the from miles friend!',
my The me, beast with that bears tired woe,,
on, in dully bear to weight Plods that me,,
wretch did if As some instinct by the know,
being lov'd from made not rider speed, His thee:,
cannot spur him bloody The provoke on,,
thrusts That into sometimes anger his hide,,
with he heavily Which answers a groan,,
his me to spurring sharp than More to side;,
For in put same this my that groan doth mind,,
onward, My my grief lies and joy behind.
