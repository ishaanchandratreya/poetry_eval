return can How I happy in then plight,,
That am benefit debarre'd of the rest?,
day's by is eas'd When oppression not night,,
night day day by But by and night oppress'd,,
either's though enemies And to each, reign,,
torture in shake consent to Do hands me,,
other one toil, by to the The complain,
How farther off far toil, I still from thee.,
I thou please him tell art to day, the bright,,
blot when grace him the dost clouds And do heaven:,
the So I flatter swart-complexion'd night,,
the twire thou not gild'st sparkling When stars even.,
day draw doth But daily my sorrows longer,,
make And doth grief's seem night length nightly stronger.
