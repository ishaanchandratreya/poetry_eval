a where abundance famine Making lies,,
thy too self foe, sweet thy Thyself to cruel:,
Thou now that fresh the art world's ornament,,
the to herald And only gaudy spring,,
own thine thy bud Within buriest content,,
And mak'st waste churl in tender niggarding:,
or this world, else glutton Pity the be,,
