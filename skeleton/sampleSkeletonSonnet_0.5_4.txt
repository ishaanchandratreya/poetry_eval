Unthrifty why thou loveliness, dost spend,
thy thy self beauty's Upon legacy?,
Nature's but nothing, gives doth bequest lend,,
those she And lends are being frank to free:,
thou beauteous Then, dost niggard, why abuse,
given largess The bounteous thee to give?,
usurer, Profitless thou why dost use,
not a sums, great yet of sum So canst live?,
thy traffic self having For with alone,,
dost of thy thy self sweet Thou self deceive:,
how calls when nature be thee Then to gone,,
audit What thou acceptable canst leave?,
Thy must unused with beauty tombed be thee,,
executor to th' used, lives Which, be.
