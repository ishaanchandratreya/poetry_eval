How thou and the make lovely sweet dost shame,
canker Which, in fragrant the like a rose,,
thy spot budding Doth of the beauty name!,
thou O! thy dost what in sweets sins enclose.,
tells that thy the of story That tongue days,,
comments lascivious on Making thy sport,,
dispraise, kind but a in Cannot of praise;,
an Naming blesses thy ill name, report.,
mansion vices those a what have O! got,
out for habitation Which their chose thee,,
every veil Where cover doth beauty's blot,
fair all turns And that eyes can things to see!,
dear this large heart, Take of heed, privilege;,
hardest The ill-us'd doth his knife lose edge.
