to bring Can sweet his him up-locked treasure,,
he will not The every hour which survey,,
For of seldom the blunting point fine pleasure.,
Therefore so are feasts so solemn and rare,,
in seldom that Since, long year coming set,,
thinly stones of placed worth they Like are,,
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.,

Or the the as doth wardrobe robe which hide,,

imprison'd new unfolding By his pride.,
Blessed you whose worthiness gives are scope,,
