by hand have fell I Time's When seen defac'd,
The buried of outworn rich-proud cost age;,
lofty towers see sometime I When down-raz'd,,
slave to brass And eternal mortal rage;,
hungry ocean I When have the seen gain,
on Advantage the the kingdom of shore,,
soil watery win the firm of the And main,,
loss and Increasing loss, with with store store;,
interchange When of seen I have such state,,
to state confounded, itself Or decay;,
Ruin to hath taught me thus ruminate--,
and will take love my come Time That away.,
cannot death This which thought is as a choose,
have, fears it But to to which that weep lose.
