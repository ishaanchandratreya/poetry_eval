With Time's injurious and crush'd hand o'erworn;,
When his fill'd drain'd have his and blood hours brow,
wrinkles; youthful and lines his With when morn,
travell'd age's to steepy Hath on night;,
all whereof he's now those beauties And king,
or Are vanished of vanishing, out sight,,
of away Stealing the his treasure spring;,
I a time such For now do fortify,
cruel Against age's confounding knife,,
never That shall from cut he memory,
though my lover's beauty, love's My sweet life:,
His lines shall be black in these beauty seen,,
they shall he and them still live, in And green.
