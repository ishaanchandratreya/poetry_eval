to for fear widow's a Is wet it eye,,
thou single thy That consum'st self in life?,
Ah! shalt thou if issueless to hap die,,
thee will The world wail a like makeless wife;,
will and world be thy widow The still weep,
left thou form thee no of That hast behind,,
well private widow every When may keep,
her children's By husband's shape in eyes, mind:,
Look! unthrift what the doth world in an spend,
still world enjoys Shifts place, his but the for it;,
But the world an hath in waste beauty's end,,
kept And the so user unused destroys it.,
others that love toward in No bosom sits,
murd'rous such on shame That himself commits.
