not do a you wherefore mightier But way,
Make war upon this tyrant, bloody Time?,
self your your fortify And in decay,
means barren my With blessed more than rhyme?,
on of stand the you happy top Now hours,,
yet And gardens, many maiden unset,,
would virtuous bear wish you With living flowers,,
painted Much than liker your counterfeit:,
So lines life the should of that life repair,,
or pupil pencil, Time's Which this, my pen,,
nor in outward worth Neither inward fair,,
your Can eyes self you live of make in men.,
To away give yourself, yourself keeps still,,
must by own your drawn you live, sweet And skill.
