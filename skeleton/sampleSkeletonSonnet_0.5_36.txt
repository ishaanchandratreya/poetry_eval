be confess that two we Let me must twain,,
are Although undivided our loves one:,
with shall those So that do blots me remain,,
be borne by me Without help, thy alone.,
our loves one two but is there In respect,,
a our Though lives separable in spite,,
love's not Which though it alter sole effect,,
sweet love's it steal hours doth Yet from delight.,
acknowledge not I may evermore thee,,
thee Lest my guilt do bewailed should shame,,
public thou with honour Nor kindness me,,
honour thou from take Unless that thy name:,
not in I do so, love thee But such sort,,
is good mine, thy being As mine thou report.
