How hath absence my like a winter been,
of thee, the the pleasure fleeting From year!,
felt, freezings what dark I What days have seen!,
What bareness old December's everywhere!,
time summer's yet And this was removed time;,
big with The rich teeming autumn, increase,,
wanton Bearing the burden the of prime,,
Like after their wombs widow'd lords' decease:,
this to Yet issue seem'd abundant me,
orphans, and unfather'd of But hope fruit;,
his on summer pleasures For wait and thee,,
thou And, the are very birds away, mute:,
sing, if with dull 'tis so they a Or, cheer,,
winter's look the leaves dreading That pale, near.
