nor nor stone, Since earth, boundless nor brass, sea,,
their mortality But sad o'ersways power,,
How a rage hold beauty shall this with plea,,
Whose stronger is a action than no flower?,
shall breath how summer's hold honey O! out,,
siege wrackful of the Against battering days,,
impregnable not are rocks so When stout,,
Nor but steel Time gates strong so of decays?,
meditation! fearful where, O alack,,
Shall lie jewel chest Time's best from Time's hid?,
hand what hold Or his swift foot can strong back?,
spoil can his who of beauty Or forbid?,
O! this none, miracle have unless might,,
my That black may still in love ink shine bright.
