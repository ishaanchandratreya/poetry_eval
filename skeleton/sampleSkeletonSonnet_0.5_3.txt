thy thou glass face and the Look in tell viewest,
form is time should Now that face the another;,
thou now repair not if fresh Whose renewest,,
world, Thou dost some unbless beguile the mother.,
For is unear'd so whose she where fair womb,
Disdains tillage of the thy husbandry?,
fond who the is so will be Or he tomb,,
stop self-love Of to his posterity?,
thy she mother's Thou glass and art in thee,
of the April lovely Calls back her prime;,
thine through windows thou of shalt age So see,,
Despite thy golden wrinkles this of time.,
But remember'd to if not thou live, be,,
thine dies with image and Die single thee.
