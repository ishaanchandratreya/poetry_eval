did that work with hours, Those gentle frame,
lovely gaze doth every where The eye dwell,,
the tyrants play the to very Will same,
that fairly unfair which doth And excel;,
time never-resting For leads summer on,
hideous confounds and winter, To him there;,
leaves Sap checked and lusty with frost, quite gone,,
Beauty every bareness o'er-snowed and where:,
distillation Then not were summer's left,,
liquid prisoner in A pent of walls glass,,
with Beauty's effect beauty were bereft,,
remembrance nor no it what Nor it, was:,
with distill'd, they though winter But flowers meet,,
but substance show; lives Leese their still their sweet.
