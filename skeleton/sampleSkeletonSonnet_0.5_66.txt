restful with all Tired these, death for I cry,,
behold desert a beggar As to born,,
And needy in trimm'd nothing jollity,,
purest unhappily faith And forsworn,,
honour And gilded shamefully misplac'd,,
maiden And rudely virtue strumpeted,,
right wrongfully And perfection disgrac'd,,
limping strength And sway by disabled,
by art tongue-tied made And authority,,
And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,,
And truth simple miscall'd simplicity,,
attending captive And captain good ill:,
I be these Tir'd these, with all from would gone,,
I die, Save my that, leave love to alone.
