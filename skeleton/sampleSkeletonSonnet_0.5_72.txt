should me, you in lived that merit What love,
me forget After death,--dear my love, quite,,
in nothing me For worthy you can prove;,
some Unless would virtuous you devise lie,,
for own than me more mine do To desert,,
deceased praise And hang more upon I,
Than would truth willingly niggard impart:,
seem lest love O! may false true your in this,
love well That speak me of for you untrue,,
where buried My my body be name is,,
shame to nor nor no And me live more you.,
I I bring For which am that by shamed forth,,
you, to things love nothing should And so worth.
