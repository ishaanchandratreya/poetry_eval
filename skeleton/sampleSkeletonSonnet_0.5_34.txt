beauteous such didst Why thou a promise day,,
my And me travel forth make without cloak,,
o'ertake clouds me in my base To let way,,
their rotten in Hiding bravery thy smoke?,
enough through thou not the cloud 'Tis that break,,
To my storm-beaten rain the dry on face,,
can no man For a well of salve such speak,,
the That cures and the heals wound, not disgrace:,
Nor my give to can shame physic thy grief;,
the still Though thou have repent, I yet loss:,
The weak but lends offender's sorrow relief,
strong To offence's bears that him the cross.,
are which tears pearl those but thy love Ah! sheds,,
they are rich and all ill ransom And deeds.
