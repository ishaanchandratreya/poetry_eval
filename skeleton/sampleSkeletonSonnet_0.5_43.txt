then wink, best I most When do eyes mine see,,
the all day they things For view unrespected;,
dreams I sleep, look But when they on in thee,,
are in bright bright, dark darkly And directed.,
thou, whose Then doth shadow make shadows bright,,
shadow's would happy form form thy How show,
clear thy with To day the much clearer light,,
unseeing to eyes shade When thy shines so!,
I would, be say, eyes blessed How mine made,
thee the looking on in living By day,,
imperfect night thy fair in When dead shade,
doth sleep heavy on sightless Through eyes stay!,
see days are see All till I to nights thee,,
And when bright dreams days thee show do nights me.
