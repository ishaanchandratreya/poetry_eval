hear, thou hear'st Music music why to sadly?,
not, in sweets with war joy delights Sweets joy:,
which thou not Why lov'st receiv'st that thou gladly,,
Or else with receiv'st pleasure thine annoy?,
the well-tuned If true of concord sounds,,
thine By married, do offend unions ear,,
do who chide but thee, sweetly They confounds,
singleness the parts shouldst In thou that bear.,
one sweet string, Mark to husband how another,,
Strikes in by each each mutual ordering;,
and happy Resembling and child sire mother,,
note pleasing one, Who, all do one in sing:,
being seeming many, speechless song Whose one,,
to Sings thee: single this prove wilt 'Thou none.'
