forty thy winters When besiege shall brow,,
trenches dig And thy beauty's deep in field,,
so livery gazed proud youth's on Thy now,,
small tatter'd of weed a be Will worth held:,
Then asked, being all where thy beauty lies,,
treasure thy the of Where lusty all days;,
own thine To within sunken say, deep eyes,,
Were an thriftless and shame, all-eating praise.,
much more thy praise beauty's deserv'd How use,,
'This of If thou answer child fair couldst mine,
old and my sum my make Shall count, excuse,',
Proving his by succession beauty thine!,
when were to thou art This new made be old,,
feel'st it warm And when blood thou thy see cold.
