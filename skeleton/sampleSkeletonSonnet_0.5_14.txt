judgement do my from I Not stars the pluck;,
I yet And have methinks astronomy,,
or evil to not But of good tell luck,,
or plagues, seasons' dearths, Of of quality;,
minutes I fortune brief Nor to can tell,,
his Pointing and to each rain thunder, wind,,
say go shall if with princes it Or well,
oft By heaven predict in I that find:,
I knowledge eyes my But from thine derive,,
stars read them such in constant I And art,
beauty 'Truth and together As shall thrive,,
thou thyself, store to from If wouldst convert';,
thee Or this else of I prognosticate:,
and doom and is truth's end beauty's 'Thy date.'
