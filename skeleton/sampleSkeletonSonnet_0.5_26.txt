my Lord to love, of in whom vassalage,
merit strongly my Thy duty hath knit,,
To written I send this thee embassage,,
witness not duty, to To my show wit:,
Duty great, so poor so as which wit mine,
make May show bare, in to seem wanting words it,,
some conceit hope But that good of I thine,
thought, will soul's all thy In naked, bestow it:,
guides whatsoever my that star Till moving,,
with graciously me fair on Points aspect,,
And apparel on tatter'd my puts loving,,
show sweet worthy of To me thy respect:,
may boast I Then dare do how to love I thee;,
not mayst Till show prove then, thou my where head me.
