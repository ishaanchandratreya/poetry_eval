My alone had all thy gentle verse grace;,
numbers gracious now are But my decay'd,,

I love, grant, lovely thy sweet argument,
worthier travail of the a Deserves pen;,

He thee it and thee pays of, robs again.,
stole virtue, that and thee lends he He word,
he behaviour; doth From beauty thy give,,

he him thank doth that not for which Then say,,
owes thyself dost Since thou thee, he what pay.
