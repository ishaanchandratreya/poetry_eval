the lion's Devouring Time, blunt thou paws,,
earth make her the devour sweet own And brood;,
Pluck keen from the teeth fierce tiger's the jaws,,
phoenix, And the her in burn long-liv'd blood;,
thou Make seasons sorry as glad and fleets,,
do thou And wilt, whate'er swift-footed Time,,
world fading wide and all the her To sweets;,
thee But most one forbid heinous I crime:,
hours not love's fair O! carve with my thy brow,,
draw thine antique with no Nor lines there pen;,
in thy Him untainted course do allow,
pattern to For succeeding beauty's men.,
thy Yet, old Time: do thy despite worst wrong,,
shall in verse love live my ever My young.
