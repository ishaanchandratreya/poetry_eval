I when how faint I do O! of you write,,
your spirit doth Knowing use better a name,,
praise And in all spends thereof his the might,,
me speaking of tongue-tied make your To fame!,
as since But your ocean worth--wide the is,--,
humble The the doth proudest as sail bear,,
far to saucy My bark, inferior his,,
doth your main wilfully broad On appear.,
hold shallowest will Your help me up afloat,,
your he upon soundless Whilst doth deep ride;,
wrack'd, worthless I a Or, being am boat,,
of of He goodly and tall building, pride:,
Then and he if I thrive cast be away,,
worst this,--my was The my was love decay.
