the absent you been I have in From spring,,
all in When dress'd April, proud-pied his trim,,
Hath put every spirit of in youth a thing,,
laugh'd with and That leap'd heavy Saturn him.,
nor lays the Yet nor the birds, sweet of smell,
different flowers in in and odour Of hue,,
any summer's make story Could me tell,,
Or their proud from pluck they lap them where grew:,
Nor at I the wonder did lily's white,,
the praise in Nor deep vermilion the rose;,
of sweet, but figures but They were delight,,
of you you, after all Drawn pattern those.,
seem'd and still, winter Yet you it away,,
with I your with As these shadow did play.
