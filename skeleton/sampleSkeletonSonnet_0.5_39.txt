O! thy with worth may how I manners sing,,
When the art part all better thou of me?,
self can to own own praise mine What mine bring?,
but mine I is't what And when praise own thee?,
for let us divided Even this, live,,
love of single And our lose name dear one,,
this That I may by separation give,
That thee which due thou deserv'st to alone.,
a wouldst absence! thou O torment what prove,,
Were gave sweet not sour leisure it thy leave,,
thoughts entertain of the time To with love,,
Which doth and so time sweetly thoughts deceive,,
make thou to teachest how And that one twain,,
who him doth By hence here praising remain.
