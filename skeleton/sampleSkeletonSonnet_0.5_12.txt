that do count When the clock the tells I time,,
in brave sunk the And day see hideous night;,
I past When violet the behold prime,,
silvered all And curls, with o'er sable white;,
barren I of see lofty trees When leaves,,
erst did the canopy Which heat from herd,,
summer's in And all green up girded sheaves,,
on bristly the and Borne white with bier beard,,
thy Then do question of beauty I make,,
time thou among of wastes the must That go,,
Since and themselves sweets do beauties forsake,
see And fast they die as others as grow;,
'gainst And nothing make Time's can scythe defence,
him to he brave breed, when Save thee takes hence.
