have I a Full morning many glorious seen,
sovereign mountain Flatter the with tops eye,,
face the meadows Kissing golden with green,,
streams with heavenly Gilding pale alchemy;,
basest the Anon clouds to permit ride,
his on ugly celestial rack With face,,
forlorn the And from visage his world hide,,
with to west unseen Stealing this disgrace:,
sun my morn one so Even early did shine,,
on splendour With all my triumphant brow;,
one hour he but out! was alack! But mine,,
cloud mask'd me him from The region hath now.,
this him love Yet my for no whit disdaineth;,
the when heaven's may sun Suns stain of world staineth.
