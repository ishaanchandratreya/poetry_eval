a summer's compare to I Shall thee day?,
and more Thou more art lovely temperate:,
darling shake of do winds Rough the buds May,,
summer's short a too And hath lease all date:,
Sometime too eye hot heaven the of shines,,
gold complexion his And is often dimm'd,,
fair every And sometime from fair declines,,
By course chance, or changing nature's untrimm'd:,
eternal not shall summer But thy fade,,
thou Nor of fair lose possession that ow'st,,
brag thou Nor wander'st in his shall death shade,,
to in lines When thou time eternal grow'st,,
breathe, as can eyes can long So or men see,,
this gives and long to lives this, So life thee.
