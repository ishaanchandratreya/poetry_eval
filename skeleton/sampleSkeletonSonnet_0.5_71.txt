I am No mourn when longer for me dead,
shall surly the hear Than sullen you bell,
Give that I world the to am warning fled,
world From vile worms vilest this to with dwell:,
Nay, you read line, if this remember not,
I love writ it, you for hand that The so,,
That thoughts be in I your would sweet forgot,,
make should thinking you then me If on woe.,
this look you say upon O! if,--I verse,,
When I perhaps compounded with am clay,,
much name Do so my not poor as rehearse;,
life even my let with love your But decay;,
world your the look wise should Lest into moan,,
me I am mock after And with you gone.
