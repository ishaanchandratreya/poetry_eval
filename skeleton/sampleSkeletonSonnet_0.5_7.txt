under burning up head, each Lifts his eye,
new-appearing homage Doth his to sight,,

And heavenly having the climb'd steep-up hill,,
strong middle Resembling his in youth age,,
his beauty adore Yet looks mortal still,,
his golden Attending on pilgrimage:,
But when weary with highmost pitch, from car,,
Like from the age, he feeble reeleth day,,
The eyes, now 'fore duteous, converted are,
and another tract, his look low From way:,
thou, in thy outgoing thyself So noon:,
a get Unlook'd, unless diest thou on son.
