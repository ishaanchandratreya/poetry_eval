barren of my so new is verse Why pride,,
far variation from So or quick change?,
do Why time the glance not with I aside,
methods, and To new-found to compounds strange?,
ever Why I write still the all one, same,,
invention in noted And keep a weed,,
word That almost my tell doth every name,,
did and birth, Showing their where they proceed?,
know O! I always of love sweet write you,,
you and my And are still love argument;,
So best dressing my all words old is new,,
is already Spending what again spent:,
is the and as new For daily sun old,,
telling is what So my still love is told.
