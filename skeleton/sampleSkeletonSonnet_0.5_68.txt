is his map cheek the of days Thus outworn,,
flowers lived beauty do as and died When now,,
Before these of were signs bastard fair born,,
durst living Or a on inhabit brow;,
of the the golden tresses Before dead,,
of were right sepulchres, shorn The away,,
live second second To a life on head;,
beauty's made dead another Ere fleece gay:,
those him In antique hours are holy seen,,
Without itself ornament, and all true,,
summer of another's no Making green,,
no old his Robbing to dress beauty new;,
him for Nature And doth as a map store,,
was beauty what To of show false Art yore.
