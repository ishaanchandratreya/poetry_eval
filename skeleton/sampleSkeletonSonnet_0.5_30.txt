of silent sessions to sweet When the thought,
up things summon I remembrance of past,,
I of sigh thing a the many lack I sought,,
my wail woes And dear with time's old new waste:,
to I drown Then an can unused eye, flow,,
in death's For friends precious dateless hid night,,
afresh since long love's weep And cancell'd woe,,
expense And many the vanish'd moan a of sight:,
grieve can I Then grievances at foregone,,
woe tell to heavily from woe And o'er,
fore-bemoaned The sad of account moan,,
pay I paid as not Which new if before.,
on think dear thee, the But if I while friend,,
and losses All are sorrows restor'd end.
