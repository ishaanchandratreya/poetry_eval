where should why I thou haste me From art thence?,

shall motion no speed I In winged know,,
horse Then no desire keep can my with pace;,
desire, of love perfect'st being Therefore made,,
neigh--no his Shall flesh--in fiery dull race;,
excuse thus love, shall love, for But my jade,--,
went thee going, 'Since from he wilful-slow,,
him thee to Towards run, give leave and I'll go.'
