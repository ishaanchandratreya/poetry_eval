his Who with his put is beside fear part,,
with some fierce thing too Or much replete rage,,
weakens his abundance strength's Whose own heart;,
I, for forget So trust, to fear of say,
perfect The ceremony love's of rite,,
love's own And seem in strength mine to decay,,
burthen mine of love's with own O'ercharg'd might.,
the looks O! let my then be eloquence,
presagers speaking dumb my And of breast,,
look for plead love, and for Who recompense,,
than more that tongue more More hath that express'd.,
love hath what learn O! to silent read writ:,
fine eyes love's To with belongs hear to wit.
