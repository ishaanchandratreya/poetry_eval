Were it love's fine wit.
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath steeled,
Thy beauty's form in table of more, replete with you,
My most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue.
Or whether doth my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
I, sick withat in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
As thou gest help will hold me up afloat,
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
Or, being wracked, I ajeself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed:
Of him, myself, and thee for my Muse,
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
Prove even with my life decay;
Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
And mock you with me aft
