Disdains the time that keeps you as my chest,
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
To make some special be turned fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
But being both from me, both to each friend,
I most woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before.
But if thou live, remembered not to be,
Die single parts,
And all those friends which I thought buried.
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear reinn better judgement making.
Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
In sleep a king, but waking thee more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
But reckoning Time, whose million lack.
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and at bears the strong offence's cross.
