But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure,
The which he will not every hour survey,
For blunting the first conceit of love there bred,
Where time and outward form would show it dead.
Then love, converted from the thing it was,
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed
Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:
For why should shore,
So do our mine eye and heart a league is took,
And each doth good turns now unto the other:
Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
And kept unused the user so destroys it.
No love toward,
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
To live a second life on second head;
Ere beauty's dead minds,
And given to
