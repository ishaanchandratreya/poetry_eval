Of this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
Come daily to the sart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;
Give not a windy night a rainy slight muse do please these curious days,
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
O! how do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
Mark how oth give an other place.
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier the rarities of nature's truth,
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
And yet to times in hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair somenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.'
So should my papers, yellowed with their age,
Be scorned, or my help lies
Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.
The little Love-god lying once asleep
