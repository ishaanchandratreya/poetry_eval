Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:
And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
Perforce am carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
Him in the brain that fonce adieu;
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
For thou art so possessed with murderous hate,
That 'gainst that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair she worst was this, my love was my decay.
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
Or you survive when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen eye is in my mind;
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind,
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
Or,
