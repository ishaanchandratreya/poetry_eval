If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
What means the world to say it is not so?
If it be not, true sight;
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
That censures falsely what they see aright?
Since hath not the power to make love groan;
To say they erre.
So is it not with me as with that Muse,
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
Who heaven itst, forget to say
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
And make Time's spoils despised every where.
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life to thee,
My life, being made of four, with two alone, how hard true sirrupting, salving thy amiss,
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
For to thy sensual fault I bried is growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
But sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
The wiry concord that mine ear confound
