Making his beauty by succession thine!
This were to be new made when thou art old,
And see thy blood wat is best, that best I wish in thee:
This wish I have; then ten times happy me!
How can my muse wand to the edge of doom.
  If this be error and upon me proved,
  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
And kept unused the user so destroys it.
No love towarden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Anon permit the basest clouds do bathereby,
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
When I do count the clock that tells the thing more;
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank be turned fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
But being both from me, both to each friend,
I do but tend
Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend;
