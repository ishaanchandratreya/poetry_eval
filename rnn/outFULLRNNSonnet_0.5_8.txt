Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:
And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
Perforce am morrow,
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
When other the disease;
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
Make the ill acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
Thy sweet belove's picture then my eye doth feast,
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
Another time mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
For precious power with power, and slay me not by art,
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
Dear heart the dregs of life,
The prey of worms, my body being dead;
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet
