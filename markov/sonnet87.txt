lease of my speaking breast,
 Who plead for love, my love, that thou mayst in me is wanting,
 And so should you, to love I always write of you,
 As he takes thee hence.
 O! that record could with a backward look,
 Even of five hundred courses of the east,
 Nor that full star that guides my moving,
 Points on me this cross:
 But here's the joy; my friend hath found that loss;
 Both find each other, and I assure ye,
 Even that your love taught it thus anew to greet;
 'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
 That followed it as day,
