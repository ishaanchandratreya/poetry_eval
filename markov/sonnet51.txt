tincture of the east,
 Nor that full star that ushers in the west;
 Which by and by black night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
 When in dead night thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
 But why thy odour matcheth not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
 To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
 Which time and outward form would show it dead.
 O! never say that thee behold,
 Thy face hath not made for store,
 Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
 Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
 Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
 She carv'd thee for her seal, and thereby,
