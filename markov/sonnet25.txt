tyranny,
 Might I not spend
 Revenge upon myself with present moan?
 What merit lived in me, that you were once unkind befriends me now,
 And for this sin there is but one hour mine,
 The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
 Yet him for this my hand, against my self depart
 As from my self a motley to the gaudy spring,
 Within thine own state,
 And thou shalt strangely pass,
 And scarcely greet me with that which I will be well esteem'd,
 So are you to my love,
 Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
 Hath left me, and I am slain,
