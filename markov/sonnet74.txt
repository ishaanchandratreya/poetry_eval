invention in a wondrous excellence;
 Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
 Her eyes so suited, and they with thee;
 Or, if they have, where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
 Disdains the tillage of thy budding name!
 O! in what sweets dost thou spend
 Upon thy part I can set down a story
 Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am fled
 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
 Nay, if you read this line, remember not
 The hand that writ it, for I love thee more,
 The more I hear and see not what they see others grow;
 And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can defence
