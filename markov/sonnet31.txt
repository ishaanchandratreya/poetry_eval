For when these quicker elements are gone
 In tender embassy of love to me, though alter'd new;
 Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
 How like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,
 Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
 Lo! thus, by day oppress'd,
 And each, though enemies to either's reign,
 Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
 The scope and tenure of thy deeds
 There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
 That, in my seeing,
 And my next self thou gav'st, thy own worth do define,
 As I all other in all surmount.
