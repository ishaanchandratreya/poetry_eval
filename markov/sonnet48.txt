more pleasing sound:
 I grant I never saw that you were once unkind befriends me now,
 And for my sake to approve her.
 If I could write the beauty of thy deceased lover,
 Compare them with the time exchang'd,
 So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
 Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
 Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
 But makes antiquity for aye his page;
 Finding the first conceit of love to tell me so;--
 As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
 No news but health from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
 Nor did I wonder at the white,
