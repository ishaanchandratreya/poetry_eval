end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'
 When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
 Do not so much of earth and sea's rich gems,
 With April's first-born flowers, and all Love's loving parts,
 And all my poverty:
 And yet, love knows it is built anew,
 Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
 So I return rebuk'd to my grief;
 Though thou repent, yet I have seen such interchange of state,
 Or state itself confounded, to decay;
 Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
 That Time will come and take my love and am belov'd,
 Where I may not remove nor remov'd.
