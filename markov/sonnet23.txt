So is the star to every wandering bark,
 Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
 Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
 Within his bending sickle's compass come;
 Love alters not with his gust is 'greeing,
 And to the sober west,
 As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's sweetest air.
 So thou prevent'st his scythe to mow:
 And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in walls of glass,
 Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
 Nor it, nor no man well of me untrue,
 My name be buried where my body is,
 And live no more dwell,
