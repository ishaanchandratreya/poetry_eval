nature calls thee to give?
 Profitless usurer, why dost thou thy fury on some worthless song,
 Darkening thy power to hurt, and will do none,
 That do not leave me last,
 When other petty griefs have done their spite,
 But in the even,
 Doth half that glory to the heart
 Of bird, of flower, or shape which it fears to lose.
 Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
 But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
 How with this disgrace:
 Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
 With all triumphant splendour on my loving,
