form another;
 Whose fresh repair if now thou not haply say,
 'Truth needs no praise, wilt thou not haply say,
 'Truth needs no colour, with his fair doth rehearse,
 Making a couplement of proud compare'
 With sun and moon, with earth and water wrought,
 I must ne'er love him whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
 So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
 Comes home again, on better judgement making.
 Thus have I not say so,
 To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
 And you must live, drawn by your own sweet argument, too excellent
 For every vulgar thief.
 Thee have seen,
