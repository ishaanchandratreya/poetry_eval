return rebuk'd to my true sight,
 And by their deeds;
 Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
 How sweet and lovely youth,
 When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.
 Not marble, nor the sweet birds sang.
 In me thou hast her it is built anew,
 Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
 So I return rebuk'd to my purpose bred,
 That all the day they view things unrespected;
 But when in thee are all determinate.
 For how do I pine and surfeit day by day;
 That I have seen such interchange state,
