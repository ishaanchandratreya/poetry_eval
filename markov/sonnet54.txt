are oaths but to misuse thee,
 And all my every part;
 And even thence thou wilt take,
 Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use,
 And sue a friend came debtor for my help lies
 Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
 The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
 I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
 And thither hied, a sad slave, stay and think of nought
 Save, where you are, how happy you make those.
 So true a fool is love, that thou none lov'st is most evident:
 For thou art twice forsworn, to me than mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
 Of the wide world and all her sweets;
