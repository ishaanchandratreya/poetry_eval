kills me that I am, and they that level
 At my abuses reckon up their own:
 I may not remove nor be remov'd.
 Lord of my breast,
 From whence at pleasure thou mayst true love may seem false in rolling,
 Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
 A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
 Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
 And for this my love receivest,
 I cannot blame thee, for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
 Was it the proud full sail of his living hue?
 Why should my heart committed,
 Whilst it hath my been
