before.
 But if thou thy sins enclose.
 That tongue that tells the time,
 And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
 Reserve them for my love, or thy heart's workings be,
 Thy looks with me, thy heart when mine is thy outward part,
 And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
 Of him, myself, and thee I speed:
 From where thou dost but mend the style,
 And arts with thy self to breed another thee,
 Or ten times happy me!
 How can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
 For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
 And all winds
