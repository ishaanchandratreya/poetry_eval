faster than Time wastes life,
 So thou be denied!
 Lo, as a death which cannot choose
 But weep to have, that which goes before,
 In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
 Nativity, once in the world should look so.
 How oft when thou, my rose, in it thou art true,
 Like a deceived husband; so love's face
 May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
 Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
 How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty and thy dear merit?
 Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
 I strive
