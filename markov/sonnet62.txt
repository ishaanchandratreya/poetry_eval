semblance to some other give:
 So should my heart think that a several plot,
 Which my heart that loves what they see aright?
 If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
 What means the world to say it is built anew,
 Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
 So I return again;
 Just to the ground;
 And for myself I do,
 Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
 Such is my deserving?
 The cause of this most balmy time,
 My love looks fresh, and Death to me than mine own love's strength seem decay,
