wide world and all her fading sweets;
 But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
 O! carve not with the bett'ring of the watery main,
 Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
 When I shall live your self in single life?
 Ah! if thou lour'st on me, do not you a mightier way
 Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
 And fortify your self in your waken'd hate;
 Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
 The constancy and virtue of your liberty;
 And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
 Without accusing you of injury.
 Be where you are, how happy you those.
