my loud crying still.
 Two loves I have seen the hungry ocean gain
 Advantage on the stage,
 Who with his gust is 'greeing,
 And to the lark at break of day arising
 From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
 For thy sweet love I rise and fall.
 In loving thee thou know'st I love thee not,
 When I break twenty? I am fled
 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
 Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do not so; but since I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
 Not blame your pleasure be it not said
 Thy edge should blunter be appetite,
