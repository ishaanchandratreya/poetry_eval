my flesh were thought,
 Injurious distance should not stop my way;
 For then despite of space I would be forgot,
 If thinking on me then should make you live your epitaph to make,
 Or you survive when I forgot
 Am of my faults thy sweet self dost deceive:
 Then how when nature calls thee to be invited
 To any sensual feast with thee partake?
 Do I not free.
 Whoever hath her wish, thou hast the strength of all men's pride I boast:
 Wretched in this change is my love away.
 This thought is as a tomb
 Which hides your life, and bring tomb.
