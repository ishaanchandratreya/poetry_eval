no other pass my verses tend
 Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
 And more, much more, than in my sight,
 Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
 What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might
 Is more than my barren rhyme?
 Now stand you on the ashes of his great verse,
 Bound for the breath that from my face she turns my foes,
 That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
 Yet do not do the thing she would have express'd
 Even such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
 Making his style admired every where.
 Our love was new, and then my eye view
