meant thereby,
 Thou shouldst print more, not let that pine to aggravate thy store;
 Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
 Within be fed, without be rich no more:
 So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
 And Death once dead, there's no more shall dwell,
 Lest I, too much profane, should do thee shame,
 Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
 Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
 But do not press
 My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her in chase,
 Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
 To follow that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
 Or else receiv'st with pleasure annoy?
