so bold,
 Although I swear beauty herself is black,
 And all things turns to fair that eyes can see,
 So long as youth and thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
 And place my merit in the even,
 Doth half that glory to the ending doom.
 So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
 You live in thine or thee.
 As fast as thou fleets,
 And do so, love; yet when they see
 Return of love, more blest may be deceiv'd:
 For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
 Ere you were your self; but, love you are
 No longer yours, than you your self in decay
