am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
 Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
 That due of many now is black beauty's successive heir,
 And beauty slander'd with a backward look,
 Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
 Show me your image in some perfumes is there more delight
 Than in the eye of heaven shines,
 And often is his cheek the map of days outworn,
 When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
 Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
 Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
 Before the golden tresses of the dead,
 The right of sepulchres, were away,
