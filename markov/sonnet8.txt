mine own praise to mine own desert,
 And hang more praise deserv'd thy beauty's field,
 Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
 Will be a gainer too;
 For bending all my best is dressing old words new,
 Spending again what is already spent:
 For as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
 So do our minutes hasten to their end;
 Each changing place with that which on thy revolt doth lie.
 O! what excuse will my poor name rehearse;
 But let your love taught it thus anew to greet;
 'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
 That followed it as day,
