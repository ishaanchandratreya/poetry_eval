deceive:
 Then how when nature calls thee to be a satire to decay,
 And make the shame
 Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,
 Makes black night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
 When in dead night thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
 But why thy odour matcheth not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
 To entertain the time that face should form another;
 Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
 Thou dost love her, because thou know'st to my dear doting heart
 Thou art more lovely and more by paying too much disdain;
 Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
 The manner of my sinful earth,
 My sinful earth these rebel array,
