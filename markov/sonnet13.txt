is crown'd;
 But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,
 In other accents do this praise confound
 By seeing farther than the eye of scorn,
 Upon thy part I can allege no cause.
 How heavy do I ensconce me here,
 Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
 And hang more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
 If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
 Shall sum my count, and make my love no whit disdaineth;
 Suns of the time,
 And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
 When I perceive that men as plants increase,
 Cheered and checked even by the grave where buried love doth denote
