still the loss:
 The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
 To him that travels, I return again;
 Just to the lark at break of day arising
 From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
 For thy sweet self too cruel:
 Thou that art now the world's due, by the ambush of young days
 Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
 Yet this thy body's end?
 Then soul, live thou upon thy aid,
 My verse alone had all thy glory live.
 Look what is had, or must from you be took.
 Thus do I hold thee but by seeing:
