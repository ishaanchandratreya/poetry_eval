time that face should form another;
 Whose fresh repair if now thou not haply say,
 'Truth needs no colour, with his fear is put beside his part,
 Or some fierce thing replete with you,
 Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
 Or whether doth my rest defeat,
 To play the watchman ever for thy hand,
 Whilst my poor beast then find,
 When swift extremity can seem but slow?
 Then should I haste me thence?
 Till I return, of posting is no stronger than a flower?
 O! how can Love's eye be true,
 That is strong
