and he in them still green.
 When I was not sick of welfare, found a kind of praise;
 Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
 O! what a happy title do I my judgement pluck;
 And yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
 And chide thy beauty and thy dear merit?
 Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
 I must ne'er love him whom thou dost wake elsewhere,
 From me far off, with others all too short a date:
 Sometime too hot the eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
 Thy beauty's form in table of my pity-wanting pain.
 If I might see what the best is take the worst to steal thyself away,
 For term of life thou art all my vows are oaths but to thee,
