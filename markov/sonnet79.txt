ten times happier, be it not with the bett'ring of the spring, and foison of the world enjoys it;
 But beauty's waste hath in the living day,
 When in dead night thy fair name.
 So that myself bring water for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
 Suffering my friend for my sake lay on me this cross:
 But here's the joy; my friend hath found that loss;
 Both find each other, and I assure ye,
 Even that your pity is enough to torture me alone,
 But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
 Me from myself thy cruel eye hath shown.
 They look into the beauty of your frame;
 Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,
 Or whether shall know,
