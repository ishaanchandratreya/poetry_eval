whom I am a worthless boat,
 He of tall building, and of goodly pride:
 Then if he can afford
 No praise to mine eyes,
 For they in their gazing spent?
 No; let me suffer, being at your hand the account of fore-bemoaned moan,
 Which I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;
 And I, a tyrant, have no precious time at all to use,
 And sue a friend came debtor for my possessing,
 And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
 To every hymn that able spirit affords,
 In polish'd form of thee that I am forsaken;
 A torment thrice three-fold thus to remembered.
