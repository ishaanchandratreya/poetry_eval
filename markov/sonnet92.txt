verse alone had all thy beauty grow,
 If thy soul check thee that I prove,
 Love's fire heats water, water cools not sweets;
 But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
 O! carve not with thy sweet respect:
 Then may I dare not be shown;
 Unless this general evil they maintain,
 All men are bad and in hue,
 Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
 And therefore to your fair no painting set;
 I found, you did impute,
 Which shall above that idle rank remain,
 Beyond all date; even eternity:
