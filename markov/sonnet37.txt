virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
 Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
 So should my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
 Come in the world besides methinks are dead.
 Since I left you, mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
 Those lines that I come so near,
 Swear to thy pure and most precious jewel.
 Yet, in good faith, some say that I am sometime absent from thy name:
 But do thy worst to be.
 If thou dost wake elsewhere,
 From me far off, with others all too near.
 Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
 And all rare,
