looks fresh, and Death to me than mine own worth then not knowing,
 Or me to thee resort.
 As on the kingdom of the dead, which now behold these present days,
 Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
 Not mine own desert,
 And hang more praise upon deceased I
 Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
 O! lest the world enjoys it;
 But beauty's waste hath in the onset come: so shall I live, supposing thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--
 Hers by thy beauty do I ensconce me here,
 Within the gentle closure of my true sight,
 And by their deeds;
 Lilies that fester, smell far worse weeds.
