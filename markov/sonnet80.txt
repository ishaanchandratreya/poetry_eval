nought by elements so slow
 But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
 The other as your bounty doth appear;
 And you must live, drawn by your own dear-purchas'd right;

 That do not so;
 Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
 And so my patent back again is swerving.
 Thy self thou harder engross'd:
