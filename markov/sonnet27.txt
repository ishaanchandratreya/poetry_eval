sweet brood;
 Pluck the keen teeth from the forlorn world his visage hide,
 Stealing unseen to west with this growing age,
 A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
 To march in ranks of better equipage:
 But since your worth--wide as the ocean be
 Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
 Come daily to the banks, that when they have devis'd,
 What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
 Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
 In true plain words, by thy granting?
 And for that sorrow, which I compile,
 Whose influence is thine, and born of love?
 Then, gentle cheater, urge not amiss,
