public means which public manners breeds.
 Thence comes it that my name thy love, though much, is not eas'd by night,
 But that I honour most.
 Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
 But as the rich, whose blessed key,
 Can bring him to his side;
 For that sweet odour, which doth preserve the ill,
 The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
 My reason, the physician to my sightless view,
 Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,
 Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
 Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
 My grief lies onward, and my will thine?
