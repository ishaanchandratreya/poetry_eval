When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
 With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
 Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
 And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
 Beshrew that heart that loves what they despise,
 Who, in despite of space I would not dull you with Fortune chide,
 The guilty goddess of my sinful earth,
 My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
 Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
 Painting thy outward part,
 And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
 I grant, sweet love, thy truth, thy constancy;
 And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to be, your being rehearse,
