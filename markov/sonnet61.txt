what is had, or must from you be took.
 Thus do I accuse thee,
 When I perceive that men as plants increase,
 Cheered and checked even by the grave where buried love doth share a part:
 So, either by thy beauty lies,
 Where all the better part of all too precious you,
 That did my ripe thoughts in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
 That hath his windows glazed with thine antique pen;
 Him in thy power
 Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;
 Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
 Thy lovers withering, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
 Or to thyself at least prove:
