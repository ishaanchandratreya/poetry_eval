angel is a greater grief
 To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.
 Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
 Kill me with spites yet we must not be shown;
 Unless this general evil they maintain,
 All men are bad and in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
 That hath his adjunct pleasure,
 Wherein it finds a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
 All this the world that I was false of heart,
 Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,
 As easy might I not spend
 Revenge upon myself with present moan?
 What merit do I not think on thee, when I thee?
