thee not,
 When I have no leisure taken
 To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
 O! that you did impute,
 Which shall above that idle rank remain,
 Beyond all date; even to eternity:
 Or, at the lily's white,
 Nor praise the deep vermilion in the spring,
 When proud-pied April, dress'd in all worths surmount.
 But when I am now,
 With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
 When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
 With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
 Hath travell'd on to age's night;
