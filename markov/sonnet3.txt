like a canker in the bay where all thy gentle grace;
 But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
 And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
 Of him, myself, and thee I so belong,
 That for thy hand,
 And buds of marjoram had stol'n of both,
 And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
 But, for their habitation chose out thee,
 Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
 And all those friends which I thought buried.
 How many a holy and obsequious tear
 Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
 As interest of roses.
