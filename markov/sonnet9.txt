presence is, gracious and kind,
 Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
 Make thee another self for love speak well of such fire,
 That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
 For shame! deny that thou send'st from thee
 So far from home into my deeds to pry,
 To find where your equal grew.
 Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
 That to my thoughts canst move,
 And I my self almost despising,
 Haply I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
 And like enough thou know'st to my bed,
 The dear respose for limbs with tir'd;
