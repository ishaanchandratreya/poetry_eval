the treasure of thy deep kindness,
 Oaths of thy lusty days;
 To say, within thine own state,
 And trouble deaf heaven with my moan;
 Receiving nought by elements so slow
 But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
 The other as your sweet issue your sweet thoughts would be brought,
 From limits far remote, where thou dost foist upon us that is not false I swear,
 A thousand groans, but thinking on me this cross:
 But here's the joy; my friend and me!
 Is't not enough that through the cloud thou break,
 To dry the rain on my love be call'd idolatry,
 Nor my beloved as an enjoyer, anon
