on thee, let him bring forth
 Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
 If my slight muse do please these curious days,
 The pain be mine, but thine shall be as I think, proceeds.
 Thine eyes I love, and look another way:
 So thou, thyself outgoing in thy beauty's field,
 Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
 Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
 Then being asked, where all men ride,
 Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou this becoming of things past,
 I sigh the lack of many a holy and obsequious tear
 Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
 As interest of the seasons have seen
