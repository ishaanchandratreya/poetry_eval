his youthful morn
 Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
 And all things turns to fair that eyes can see,
 So long lives this, and this by that which goes before,
 In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
 Nativity, once in the number let me suffer, being at your hand the account of hours to crave,
 Being your slave what should I haste me to whom in vassalage
 Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
 To thee I speed:
 From where thou art.
 Gentle thou art, therefore to be vile than vile esteem'd,
 When not to show her pride,
 The argument, all bare, is of worth
