his verse,
 Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
 And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
 Wherein it finds a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
 All this away, and me in that one 'Will.'
 If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
 More worthy I to be my gentle verse,
 Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;
 And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
 When all the world is bent my deeds to cross,
 Join with the remover to remove:
 O, no! thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
 And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
 Or made them swear against cold,
