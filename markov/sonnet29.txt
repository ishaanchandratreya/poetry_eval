horse;
 And every fair with his brief hours and weeks,
 But bears it out even to eternity:
 Or, at the lily's white,
 Nor praise the deep vermilion in the world's fresh ornament,
 And only herald to the sessions of sweet silent thought
 I summon up remembrance of things ill,
 That in the rose;
 They were but the seemly raiment of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
 O! but with thy hours my love's fair brow,
 Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
 Him in thy affairs, fall by thy deeds;
 Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
 To thy fair shade
