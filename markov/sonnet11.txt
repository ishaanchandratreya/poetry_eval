hast her it is but as a dream doth flatter,
 In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
 When thou art why should others' false adulterate eyes
 Give salutation to my bed,
 The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
 But then begins a journey in my mind,
 My grief lies onward, and my loud crying still.
 Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
 Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
 The better angel from my mistress reeks.
 I love what others do abhor,
 With others thou shouldst depart,
 Leaving thee living posterity?
