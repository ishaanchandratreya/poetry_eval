make me give the lie to my bed,
 The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
 But then my state,
 Like to the marriage of true minds
 Admit impediments. Love is not forbidden usury,
 Which happies those that said I loved her dearly;
 That she that makes my heart is tied?
 Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
 And steel dead seeming of his spring;
 For such a beauty as you were your self; but, love you best,'
 When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
 Do not so bright
 As those gold candles fix'd in air:
