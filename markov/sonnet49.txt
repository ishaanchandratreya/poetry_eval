in me,
 The one doth shadow of your frown,
 But shoot not at me in your crime.
 O! that record could with a backward look,
 Even of five hundred courses of the time,
 And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
 When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
 When as thy love will stay,
 For it no form of thee this I prognosticate:
 'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'
 When I have confess'd that he is thine,
 And I my judgement pluck;
 And yet methinks I have no leisure taken
 To weigh how once I suffer'd in will,
