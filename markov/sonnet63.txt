that able spirit affords,
 In polish'd form of thee that due,
 Uttering bare truth, even so as thou lov'st me for my sin you did impute,
 Which shall above that idle rank remain,
 Beyond all date; even to eternity:
 Or, at the sun's eye,
 And in his middle age,
 Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
 Attending on his celestial face,
 And from the day,
 The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
 From his low tract, and look for recompense,
 More than that tongue that tells the story of days,
