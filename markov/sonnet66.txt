pride
 Which on thy part:
 To leave for nothing all thy gentle grace;
 But now my greatest grief,
 Thou best of love.
 Now all is done, save what shall be most my glory being dumb;
 For I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
 The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
 When sometime lofty towers I see barren of leaves,
 Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
 And summer's green all girded up in any chest,
 Save where thou dost wake elsewhere,
 From me far off, with others all too short a lease,
 Dost thou upon thy fading spend?
