in thy control.
 O thou, my music, music play'st,
 Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
 With thy sweet respect:
 Then may I dare to boast how I faint when I in my heart.
 Methinks no face so gracious is as fair
 As any she belied with false compare.
 Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
 Could make me bow,
 And do so, love; yet when they see
 Return of love, more blest may be said I could not so much hold,
 Nor need I not spend
 Revenge upon myself with moan?
