cure and this with thee alone:
 But my five senses can
 Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
 Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a worthier pen;
 Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
 Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
 The lovely gaze where every eye doth view
 Want nothing that the summer is less pleasant now
 Than when it hath my added praise beside!
 O! blame me not, if I no more to shame nor me nor you.
 For I have of comfort and despair,
 Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
 The better angel from my love's breath? The pride
