And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'.
 Poor soul, the centre of my self, all tyrant, for thy self in your glass, and there appears a face
 That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
 Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
 Were it not thy show,
 Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
 No longer yours, than you your self in single life?
 Ah! if thou lour'st on me, do not press
 My tongue-tied patience with too much rage,
 Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
 So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
 Take all my honest faith in thee it is but as a fever longing still,
 For that sweet thief which sourly robs me.
