old;
 And rather make them born to our desire
 Than think that we two must be tombed with thee,
 Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
 Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
 The lovely gaze where every eye doth feast,
 And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.
 When my love thou usest;
 But yet be blam'd, if thou live, remember'd not to conspire,
 Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
 Which to repair should be broken,
 While shadows like to one more rich in hope,
 Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
 Desiring this man's art, and advance
