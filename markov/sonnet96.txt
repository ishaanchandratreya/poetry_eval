birth, some in their glory die.
 The painful warrior famoused for fight,
 After a thousand victories once foil'd,
 Is from the book of honour razed quite,
 And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
 Beshrew that heart that makes my heart think that we before have writ do lie,
 Even those that pay the willing loan;
 That's for thy self the thanks, if aught in me
 Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
 For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
 Thine by thy deeds;
 Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
 To thy sweet graces be;
