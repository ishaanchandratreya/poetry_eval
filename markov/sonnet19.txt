thou art?
 O! therefore love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
 Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
 To-morrow see again, and straight grow sad.
 Mine eye well knows what with his fear is put beside his part,
 Or some fierce thing replete with too much rent
 For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
 Pitiful thrivers, in their hawks and hounds, some in their skill,
 Some in their horse;
 And every fair from fair sometime declines,
 By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
 But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
 Nor lose possession of that which governs me to justify the wrong
 That thy unkindness lays upon heart;
