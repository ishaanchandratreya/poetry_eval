your memory death cannot take,
 Although in me each part will be true despite thy wrong,
 My love shall be most my glory being dumb;
 For I am forsaken;
 A torment thrice three-fold thus to be new made when thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
 And place my merit in the spring,
 When I have no correspondence with true sight;
 Or, if they have, where is she so fair a house fall to decay,
 Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
 Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
 And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
 O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
 You had a father: let your son so.
