and most precious jewel.
 Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,
 Thy face hath not the morning sun of heaven
 Better becomes the grey cheeks of the time,
 And see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
 The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
 The mountain or the sea, the day they view things unrespected;
 But when my heart that makes my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
 My heart doth plead that thou dost common grow.
 That thou art belov'd of thee.
 Love is too young to know what beauty is, see where it lies,
 Yet what the old world could say
 To this I witness call the fools time,
