dost thou to mine own fears, nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet birds sang.
 In me thou see'st the twilight of such account;
 And for that which governs me to thee which thou hast done:
 Roses have thorns, and play as wantonly
 When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
 But, for his love'.
 Full many a holy and obsequious tear
 Hath dear religious love stol'n from thee.
 I tell the day, to please him thou art all the winds
 Which should example where your true love that still,
 And you but one, and me most wretchcd make.
 But do not so, I love not less, though less the show appear;
 That love is better than high birth me,
