ruth upon my pain.
 And truly not the dust and injury of age,
 Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
 But makes antiquity for aye his page;
 Finding the first conceit of this excess,
 Eat up thy charge? Is this thy golden time.
 But if thou thy self were happier than thou hadst before?
 No love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
 'Will', will fulfil the treasure of his spring;
 For such a scope to show what wealth she had
 In days long since, before these last so bad.
 Thus is his gold complexion dimm'd,
 And every fair with his fix'd;
