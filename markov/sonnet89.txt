it, else mistaking;
 So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
 Comes home again, on better judgement making.
 Thus have I drunk of Siren tears,
 Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
 Applying fears to lose.
 Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
 But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
 How with this disgrace:
 Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
 With all triumphant splendour on my frailties why are frailer spies,
 Which in thy noon:
 Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get son.
