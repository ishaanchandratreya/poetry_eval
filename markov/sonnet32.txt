a-doting,
 And by a painted beauty to his store;
 So thou, thyself outgoing in thy beauty's legacy?
 Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
 And being frank she lends to those are free:
 Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
 Painting thy outward part,
 And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
 I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
 Deserves the travail of a throned queen
 The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
 For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
 Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
 How sweet and youth,
