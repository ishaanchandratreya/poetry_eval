to ruminate--
 That Time will come and part;
 And for that which thou departest;
 And that is that which longer nurseth the disease;
 Feeding on that which flies before her face,
 Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
 So runn'st thou after that which thou hast done:
 Roses have thorns, and play as wantonly
 When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
 But, for his scythe to mow:
 And yet this time removed was summer's time;
 The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
 Bearing the wanton burden of the shore,
 And the sad augurs mock their presage;
