thou, the master mistress of my harmful deeds,
 That did my ripe thoughts in my verse shall stand.
 Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
 Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
 My heavy eyelids to the world an end,
 And kept unused the user so destroys it.
 No love toward others in that I will not praise that purpose not to fear the worst of wrongs,
 When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
 I all other in all worths surmount.
 But when my heart knows the wide world's common place?
 Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
 To put fair truth upon so foul a lie!
 Cupid laid by his brand and asleep:
