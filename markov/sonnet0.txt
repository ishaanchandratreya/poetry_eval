as I am attainted;
 That thou art covetous, and he stole that word
 From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
 And found it in thy creation did decree
 That in black ink my love receivest,
 I cannot know thy change.
 In many's looks, the false heart's history
 Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.
 But heaven in thy breast doth lie:
 That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
 No marvel then, though I love thee in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
 And wear their brave state out of sight,
 Stealing away the treasure of his verse,
