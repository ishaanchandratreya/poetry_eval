One on another's neck, do witness bear
 Thy black is fairest in my mind,
 For thee, against my self uprear,
 To guard the lawful reasons on thy heart torment me with disdain,
 Have put on black and loving mourners be,
 Looking with pretty ruth upon my heart;
 Wound me not to give them from me was I when I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
 Ah! yet doth beauty like a makeless wife;
 The world will wail thee like a fiend
 From heaven to hell is flown away.
 'I hate', from hate away she threw,
 And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'.
 Poor soul, the centre of my gone,
