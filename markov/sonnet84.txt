with weary car,
 Like feeble age, he reeleth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
 And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;
 Make glad and sorry seasons as thou lov'st those
 Whom thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
 And constant stars in them I read such art
 As 'Truth and beauty on my brow;
 For what care I who calls me well or ill,
 So you o'er-green my bad, my good one out.
 Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
 Breathed forth the sound that said I loved her dearly;
 That she hath no exchequer now but his,
 And proud of many, lives upon gains.
