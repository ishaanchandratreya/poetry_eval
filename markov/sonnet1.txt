thy fair appearance lies.
 To side this title is impannelled
 A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the ground;
 And for my love swears that she thinks me young,
 Although she knows my days are past the best,
 Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
 On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
 But wherefore do not kill
 The spirit of youth to sullied night,
 And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
 And moan the expense of many a glorious morning have I lost; thou hast her it is abus'd.
 I never saw a goddess go,--
 My mistress, when she saw my state,
