imitated after you;
 On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
 And you in every part.
 Then will I pray that thou send'st from thee
 So far from home into my deeds to cross,
 Join with the time that keeps mine eye is my love that still,
 And in mine own fears, nor the past,
 For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?
 Both truth and beauty on my tatter'd loving,
 To show me worthy of thy budding name!
 O! in what sweets dost thou to mine own desert,
 And this my love be call'd idolatry,
 Nor my beloved as an enjoyer, anon
