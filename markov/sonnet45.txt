heart a league is took,
 And each doth good turns now unto the other:
 When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.
 Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
 Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
 But you like none, none you, for constant heart.
 O! how can Love's eye be true,
 That is so grounded inward in my purpose bred,
 That all the day they view things unrespected;
 But when she saw my woeful state,
 Straight in her maiden hand
 The fairest votary took up that fire
 Which many legions of true hearts warm'd;
