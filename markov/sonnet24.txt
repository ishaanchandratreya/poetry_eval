witness bear
 Thy black is fairest in my mind, when body's work's expired:
 For then my friend's heart let my heart to sway?
 To make me any summer's story tell,
 Or from their physicians know;--
 For, if I should in thought control your times of your love.
 Like as, to make me travel forth without my cloak,
 To let base clouds o'ertake me in my sight,
 Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
 To change your day of youth in his controlling,
 Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
 And for a map doth Nature store,
 To show me worthy of thy sweet self prove:
 For, thou betraying me, I do forgive thy robbery, thief,
