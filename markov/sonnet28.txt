But being both from me, both to each friend,
 I guess one angel in another's hell:
 Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
 But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;
 For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
 And, thou away, the very worst of wrongs,
 When in eternal lines to time your own dear-purchas'd right;
 That I may not remove nor be remov'd.
 Lord of my love, yea take them all;
 What hast thou this powerful might,
 With insufficiency my heart another youth,
 And worse essays prov'd thee my best doth worship thy defect,
 For slander's mark was ever yet the lease of my lameness, and I straight halt,
