Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
 And brought to medicine a healthful state
 Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;
 But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
 Drugs poison him that travels, I return rebuk'd to my sightless view,
 Which, like a canker in the praise thereof spends all his trim,
 Hath put a spirit of love, more blest may be straight though they with winter meet,
 Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
 Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
 In thee thy poet doth invent
 He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
 He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
 From thy behaviour; beauty doth give,
