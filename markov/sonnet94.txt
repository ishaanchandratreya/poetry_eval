yea take them all;
 What hast thou this becoming of things past,
 I sigh the lack of many now is thine alone:
 Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
 And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
 Beshrew that heart that loves what they see?
 They know what conscience is,
 Yet who knows not conscience is born of thee:
 In others' works thou dost hate.
 Then hate me when thou from youth convertest,
 Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
 Without this folly, age, and cold decay:
 If all were minded so, the times cease
