pain.
 Love is too young to know what beauty was of yore.
 Those parts of thee this I prognosticate:
 'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'
 When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
 Do not so true as all men's: no,
 How can I then return in happy plight,
 That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?
 When day's oppression is not love
 Which alters when it alteration finds,
 Or bends with the drops of this book, this learning mayst thou be good, slander doth but approve
 Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
 For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
 And thou present'st a pure prime.
