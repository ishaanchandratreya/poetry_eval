her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
 In pursuit of the shore,
 And the just pleasure lost, which is his cheek the map of days outworn,
 When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
 Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
 Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
 Before the golden tresses of the watery main,
 Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
 When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
 The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
 When sometime lofty towers I see barren of leaves,
 Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
 And summer's green all girded up sheaves,
