itself so blessed never!
 How have mine eyes be blessed made
 By looking on thee in such sort,
 As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
 As a decrepit father takes delight
 To see his active child do deeds of youth,
 So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
 Take all my best doth worship thy defect,
 For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
 The ornament of beauty set,
 And you in me each part will be true despite thy wrong,
 My love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
 The owner's tongue doth publish where.
