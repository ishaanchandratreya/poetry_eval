is my deserving?
 The cause of this large privilege;
 The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.
 Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
 Some say thy grace is youth and thou are of one date;
 But when my heart to groan
 For that sweet odour, which doth preserve the ill,
 The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
 My reason, the physician to my thoughts canst move,
 And I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;
 For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
 And thou in him dost lie,--
 A closet never pierc'd with eyes--
