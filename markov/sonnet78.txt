men's pride I boast:
 Wretched in this line some interest,
 Which for their style I'll read, his for his theft, in pride of all thy might?
 Spend'st thou thy self to breed another thee,
 Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
 Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
 Within the gentle closure of my sin, and thy years full well befits,
 For still temptation follows where thou art covetous, and he is kind;
 He learn'd but surety-like to write for me,
 Under that bond that him as for a look;
 Possessing or pursuing no delight,
 Save what is already spent:
 For as you recite
