with newer might
 To me are nothing like the ocean is,--
 The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
 But that so fell sick of any fear from thence:
 But when I of you do anything, he thinks no ill.
 That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
 I should in thought control your times of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
 To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
 And, sick of welfare, found a kind of praise;
 Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
 O! what excuse will my poor name rehearse;
 But let your love even with my life hath end.
 I thee,
